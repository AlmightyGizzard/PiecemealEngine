# The Piecemeal Engine
A Rudimentary game engine complete with a functional ECS.

### Installation
Currently, this is just a VS2019 project that I am periodically adding to. 
It is written entirely in **C++** and will eventually have a playable .exe, which I'll put here.
I plan to recreate the garbage game I created during my game engine assignment (see below) but in a more extensible ECS system.

### Background and Aim
During the beginning of 2021, I was given an assignment as part of my 2nd year at University. That assignment was to **build a game engine from scratch** in C++. 

I set about building this project, primarily in an Object-Oriented fashion as I had been shown in lectures and workshops. 

And then a particular lecture came alone - two weeks before the deadline - and explained how Entity Component Systems are not only a great alternative, but can offer a wider range of perks and often are simpler to debug once the initial foundations are built. They also seem to be the emerging norm for many large scale engines, so learning how to build one could prove very valuable.

I did not have time to build one then, so I'm building one now, stripping my handed-in engine entirely and rebuilding it over summer to create this project.
